            <p>See what I mean?</p>
            <p>Probably not so I will explain it to you. In Dutch we pronounce the numbers in wrong order, with 21 for example it is like saying one-twenty</p>
            <p>With big numbers it gets even more confusing. here are some more examples</p>
            <p class="note-box">
                <strong>Note:</strong> The translation is not correct but translated with the same logic as Dutch.

<!--         <p>2 = twee (in English two)</p> 
            <p>11 = elf (in English eleven) nothing wierd here</p>
            <p>14 = veertien (in English fourteen) still nothing wierd</p>
            <p>21 = eenentwintig (in English twenty-one) okay now it gets wierd</p>
            <p>36 = zesendertig (in English thirty-six) see what I mean?</p>
            <p>Probably not so I will explain it to you. In Dutch we pronounce the numbers in wrong order, with 21 for example it is like saying one-twenty</p>
            <p>With big numbers it gets even more confusing. here are some more examples</p>

            <p>21.345 = eenentwintigduizend driehonderd vijfenveertig (like saying one-twenty-thousand three-hundred five-forty)</p> -->
            <p>Okay let me explain to you why this is a problem. This verry iritating when you're rembering a number in your head and you wan't to write it down because in your head you say the number in wrong order but when you need to write it down you need to write it in the right order. But sometimes when you're not regardful this goes wrong and you write down the wrong number!</p>

    <section class="conclusion-box">
    <h3>My conclusion</h3>
    <p>So my suggestion is to change the way we pronounce numbers in Dutch to the same way as in English so that 21 is pronounced as twintigeneen (twenty-one) instead of eenentwintig (one-twenty). This will make it easier to rember numbers and write them down correctly.</p>
